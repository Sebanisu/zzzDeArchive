# zzzDeArchive
Tool to create/extract/merge zzz archives for FF8 Remastered

When you run the EXE it'll give you prompts for paths to files or folders. Just follow the prompts and you should have no issue.

There is some minor command line support as well.

Extract zzz to folder.<br/>
`zzzDeArchive "path to zzz file" "path to folder"`

Write folder to __out.zzz__.<br/>
`zzzDeArchive "path to folder"`

Merge two zzz files to __out.zzz__.<br/>
`zzzDeArchive "path to zzz with new data" "path to zzz with old data"`
